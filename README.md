## Final Project for CS 6710: Cantennas

The goal of this project was to design four cantennas using different sized cans and testing which can size was the most effective at extending the range of a wireless network. We also wanted to take the project a step further and design a Yagi antenna. We want to measure the performance of these cantennas and the Yagi using real-world experiments.
